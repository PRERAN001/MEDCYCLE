# 🌿 MedCycle  

## 📌 Project Overview  
MedCycle is a community-driven platform where users can upload unused or near-expiry medicines 🏥. It allows individuals to contribute to a shared medicine pool, helping those in need while reducing waste.  

### 🔹 Key Features

- **Expiry Alerts:** Users receive a reminder 📅 one month before the expiry date.  
- **Disposal Guidance:** Proper disposal methods for expired medications ♻️.  
- **SOS Feature:** Users can send urgent medicine requests 🚨, notifying nearby users instantly.  
- **Medicine Authentication:** Using ML & OpenCV to verify medicines via image capture 📷.  

## ⚙️ Technology Stack  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, OpenCV  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. **Upload Medicines** 📝 – Enter medicine details or capture an image for authentication.  
2. **Community Access** 🤝 – Users view available medicines and request needed ones.  
3. **Expiry Alerts** ⏳ – Notifications ensure timely usage before expiration.  
4. **SOS Feature** 🆘 – Urgent requests notify nearby users instantly.  

## 🎯 Future Enhancements  
- AI-based prescription matching 🧠  
- Blockchain-based verification 🔗
